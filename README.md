#Antiquated Inspector
###Inspect CSS in older browsers

##Usage

1. Include the antiquated.js in your page, preferrably in the head tags. Feel free to copy the code below into your page.
NOTE: Antiquated requires jQuery 1.2.6+. If jQuery isn't present in your page, it will include it for you automatically.

```
<head>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/antiquated.js"></script>
</head>
```

2. Hold down SHIFT, and mouseover an element you want to inspect. You'll see the very blue inspector show up near your mouse. You can let go of SHIFT, and the inspector will sit there patiently like a good dog so you can copy a selector or ponder deeper with furrowed brow what you've learned. Works well in IE8 and 9. And modern browsers like Chrome. Enjoy...hopefully.

##Changing that horrible blue color...
Some people won't appreciate my insane love for #0094FF (cerulean blue) so you can go into the antiquated.js file and change the hex code if you like. No harm no foul. Don't expect the Smurfs to like you anymore.
